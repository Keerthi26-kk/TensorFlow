TensorFlow Projects: Fake Regression & Cancer Classification

Overview

This repository contains two deep learning projects utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for predictive modeling:

Fake Regression (Fake_Reg) â€“ A regression model built using TensorFlow to predict continuous values based on simulated data.
Cancer Classification â€“ A deep learning classifier to detect cancer presence based on medical imaging or tabular data.
Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

1. Fake Regression (Fake_Reg)

Objective
The goal of this project is to build a regression model using TensorFlow to predict a continuous target variable. The dataset consists of randomly generated values, making it ideal for understanding regression fundamentals.

Methodology
âœ” Data Generation â€“ Created a synthetic dataset with independent variables and a dependent target variable.
âœ” Feature Scaling â€“ Normalized input features for improved model performance.
âœ” Model Architecture â€“ Implemented a fully connected neural network using TensorFlow & Keras.
âœ” Loss Function & Optimization â€“ Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and Adam optimizer for model training.
âœ” Performance Evaluation â€“ Visualized loss curves and measured model accuracy using RÂ² score and RMSE.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow & Keras for deep learning model implementation
NumPy & Pandas for data processing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Results
Achieved a low Mean Squared Error, indicating accurate regression predictions.
Demonstrated the ability of a neural network to approximate relationships in synthetic data.
2. Cancer Classification

Objective
This project aims to develop a deep learning classification model using TensorFlow to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on input medical data.

Dataset
Utilized a dataset containing tumor features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness).
The target variable: Malignant (1) or Benign (0).
Methodology
âœ” Data Preprocessing â€“ Handled missing values, normalized features, and encoded labels.
âœ” Model Architecture â€“ Designed a multi-layer neural network (MLP) for classification.
âœ” Activation Functions â€“ Used ReLU in hidden layers and Sigmoid in the output layer.
âœ” Loss Function & Optimization â€“ Applied Binary Crossentropy Loss with the Adam optimizer.
âœ” Evaluation Metrics â€“ Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow & Keras for deep learning modeling
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Results
Achieved high classification accuracy, successfully distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
Showcased the effectiveness of deep learning in medical data analysis.
